Here’s a summary of the conversation so far:

	1.	Initial Modeling:
	•	We started by exploring how to model relationships between Individuals and Beliefs/Faiths, discussing whether faith should be a cross-section of beliefs, a specific type of belief, or a distinct concept. The recommendation was to treat Faith as a distinct concept for realism and flexibility.
	2.	Modeling Beliefs:
	•	We discussed whether beliefs should be atomic (single entities) or split into Concept and Sentiment to model varying perspectives on a single idea (e.g., “Charity is good” vs. “Charity is bad”).
	•	Ultimately, we leaned toward simplifying the model by linking Individuals directly to Concepts, with a relationship capturing Sentiment (e.g., strongly agree, disagree).
	3.	Naming Relationships:
	•	Suggested terms for naming the relationship between Individual and Concept, such as Perspective, Alignment, Conviction, Opinion, Disposition, and Stance.
	•	The user preferred simplicity by naming join tables as IndividualConcept and other combinations, avoiding a third term unless necessary.
	4.	Alternatives to “Concept”:
	•	Explored potential replacements for Concept (e.g., Idea, Principle, Value, Doctrine, Tenet, Ethos, Philosophy, Perspective, etc.).
	•	The user selected Doctrine for its clarity and purpose, even though it might be slightly specific.

Final Direction:
	•	The user has decided to use Doctrine as the central term representing abstract ideas or principles.
	•	The relationship between entities (e.g., IndividualDoctrine, OrganizationDoctrine) will be represented simply and clearly, with "sentiment" field capturing the individual’s or entity’s stance.

Key Changes
	1.	Doctrine as Central Concept:
	•	Replaced “Belief” and “Concept” with Doctrine to represent abstract ideas or principles clearly.
	2.	Individual and Doctrine Relationship:
	•	Replaced IndividualBelief with IndividualDoctrine, capturing the sentiment (e.g., agree/disagree) and optional notes for context.
	3.	Organization and Doctrine Relationship:
	•	Added OrganizationDoctrine to model how organizations align with doctrines, using a similar sentiment field.
	4.	Faith as a Collection of Doctrines:
	•	Replaced FaithBelief with FaithDoctrine to show that faiths are composed of multiple doctrines, with an optional importance weight.
	5.	Simplified Attributes:
	•	Removed unused attributes like faith_level from Individual, aligning with the focus on doctrine relationships.

Example Scenarios
	1.	An Individual’s Stance on Charity:
	•	Doctrine: “Charity”
	•	IndividualDoctrine: sentiment = 2 (STRONGLY_AGREE)
	2.	A Faith’s Core Tenets:
	•	Faith: “Christianity”
	•	FaithDoctrine: Includes doctrines like “Charity” and “Forgiveness” with specific importance weights.
	3.	An Organization’s Alignment:
	•	Organization: “Red Cross”
	•	OrganizationDoctrine: Aligns strongly with “Charity” (sentiment = 2) and “Neutrality” (sentiment = 1).

This updated model simplifies and clarifies the relationships while retaining flexibility for realistic and complex scenarios.
