Update the diagram,
instead of using "many-to-many" relationships (}--{), use "one-to-many" relationships and indicate all of the "join" tables that would be needed to represent these relationships in a relational database.

When creating the eml, include inline comments to explain the purpose and structure of each class and relationship and attribute

---

Here’s the updated UML diagram with the requested modifications, switching from many-to-many relationships (}--{) to one-to-many relationships (}o-- or }--|) and adding join tables to reflect relational database structures. I’ve also added inline comments to explain each element.

Explanation of Changes
	1.	Attributes and Properties: Each class includes detailed attributes based on your request.
	2.	Join Tables: Replaced many-to-many relationships with explicit join tables to model these relationships in a relational database.
	3.	EventImpact: A polymorphic table (impacted_type and impacted_id) was added to track event impacts on various entities.
	4.	FaithEvolution: Faith evolution relationships are now one-to-many, with a join table representing merges, splits, or reforms between faiths.

This updated model provides a detailed, relational structure suitable for implementing a religion simulation system in a database. The comments clarify the purpose of each class and relationship.
