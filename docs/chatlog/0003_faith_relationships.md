expand on ways this could be improved:

```
Individual
  + role : string         ' leader, follower, seeker
  + faith_level : string  ' devout, moderate, skeptic
```

thinking, it should be expressed as -1 to 1, indicating that they'd be potentially _against_ certains beliefs and faiths

also, should not be at user level, rather should be at the join-table levels

Here are three ways to improve the representation of faith_level and role for individuals and their associations with beliefs and faiths. Each suggestion moves towards a more nuanced and flexible model.

1. Replace faith_level with a Numeric Range (-1 to 1) in Join Tables
	•	Change: Move faith_level to the join tables (e.g., IndividualFaith or IndividualBelief) as a numeric value ranging from -1 to 1:
	•	-1: Strong opposition
	•	0: Neutral
	•	1: Strong support

Pros:
	•	Allows individuals to have different levels of agreement or opposition to specific beliefs and faiths, reflecting complex dynamics.
	•	Enables nuanced interactions, such as partial alignment with one belief but rejection of another within the same faith.
	•	Simplifies computations for aggregate metrics (e.g., total support for a faith in a location).

Cons:
	•	Requires additional validation to ensure consistency (e.g., preventing individuals from being both strongly for and against the same belief).
	•	Numeric representation might lack explanatory context unless paired with textual labels (e.g., “devout” or “skeptic”).

2. Use a Multi-Dimensional Vector for Beliefs and Faith Alignment
	•	Change: Represent faith_level as a multi-dimensional vector stored in the join tables. Each dimension represents an aspect of alignment (e.g., moral alignment, spiritual alignment, cultural alignment).

Pros:
	•	Captures deeper complexity, allowing individuals to align with some aspects of a belief or faith while rejecting others.
	•	Facilitates advanced analytics, such as clustering individuals based on shared alignments or visualizing alignment trends.
	•	Opens possibilities for machine-learning-driven insights (e.g., predicting how individuals might react to new beliefs).

Cons:
	•	Significantly increases implementation complexity, requiring well-defined vector dimensions and a way to interpret the data.
	•	May be computationally expensive for large datasets.
	•	Harder to represent and explain to non-technical stakeholders without additional tools or visualizations.

3. Add Historical Context and Dynamic Alignment
	•	Change: Add a faith_level_history field to the join tables to track changes in alignment over time, coupled with dynamic alignment rules:
	•	Fields: faith_level_start, faith_level_end, change_rate, last_updated
	•	Example: If an individual starts neutral and slowly becomes devout, their alignment changes over time based on interactions.

Pros:
	•	Reflects real-world dynamics where belief alignment evolves over time due to events or interactions.
	•	Provides historical context for alignment changes, useful for storytelling, simulations, or understanding shifts in faith dynamics.
	•	Opens possibilities for event-driven systems, where an Event triggers alignment shifts.

Cons:
	•	Requires more storage and computational overhead to track changes and simulate alignment evolution.
	•	Adds complexity to query logic, especially when determining an individual’s current alignment.
	•	Requires well-defined rules for dynamic updates (e.g., thresholds for significant changes).

Additional Considerations
	•	Role Flexibility: Replace the role string with a dynamic relationship to an attribute or model (e.g., Role table), allowing roles to evolve or differ by context.
	•	Example: A leader in one faith might be a follower in another, which could be tracked in IndividualFaith.
	•	Cultural Factors: Introduce a cultural bias dimension in join tables, showing how cultural background influences alignment with beliefs and faiths.
	•	Scalable Ratings: Instead of a simple numeric scale, use probabilistic or fuzzy logic models to reflect the uncertainty in alignment.

Each of these improvements addresses different aspects of complexity and nuance in simulating individual-faith dynamics, allowing you to choose the best approach based on the goals and technical constraints of your system.

I don't understnad this

can you provide some examples, perhaps what this owuld look like in django
